    \section{Tests and Experiments}
    
    The main factors which contribute to the success and shortcomings of our system are the choice of architecture, bit packing and evolving the board in place. These factors together allow us to process images larger than \verb|1024x1024|. We tested our system in multiple ways, such as:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{-0.2\baselineskip}
        \item Comparing two iterations of a \verb|32x32| image to another implementation of the Game of Life. (Figure \ref{fig:test32})
        \item Examining some sample generations of a \verb|1024x1024| image starting from a straight line. (Figure \ref{fig:test1024})
        \item Varying the worker count and image size. (Section \ref{workercount})
        \item Changing the distribution of workers across the tiles. (Section \ref{??})
        \item Comparing asynchronous channels with synchronous channels. (Section \ref{??})
    \end{itemize}

            \label{fig:agt}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \begin{center}
            \input{agtplot.tex}
            \caption{Log plot of Average Generation Time vs. Worker Count.}
            \label{fig:agtplot}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    We can measure the processing speed by the AGT (Average Generation Time). From Figure \ref{fig:agt} it's clear that increasing the number of workers is effective at reducing the AGT, although only up to a point. Regardless of worker count, the AGT for \verb|64x64| and \verb|32x32| remains at 11.64, and the AGT for \verb|128x128| with 8 workers is also 11.64. This implies that there is a bottleneck in our system, either fundamentally by the processor speed or by a design choice of ours.

    However for the larger images, doubling the worker count halves the AGT, which implies that increasing the workers gives a \textit{linear} speed up, and this is reflected by the straight lines in Figure \ref{fig:agtplot}. Furthermore, increasing the image size by a factor of 4 also increases the AGT by a factor of 4; this is expected since an $n$-fold increase in the number of cells is an $n$-fold increase in the amount of work. A nice consequence of this behaviour is that the AGT of an image with $n$ cells and $m$ workers is approximately the same as the AGT of an image with $4n$ cells and $4m$ workers (e.g. the AGT of \verb|128x128| with 2 workers is approximately equal to the AGT of \verb|256x256| with 8 workers).
