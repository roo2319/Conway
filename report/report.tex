    \section{Tests and Experiments}
    (2 pages max): Show the result of the given 16x16 image after 2 rounds. Describe briefly the other experiments you carried out, provide a selection of appropri ate results and output images. This must be done for at least the example images provided and for at least one example image of your own choosing (showcasing the merit of your system). List the important factors responsible for virtues and limitations of your system.

    \section{Critical Analysis}
    Critical Analysis (1 page max): Discuss the performance of your program with reference to the results obtained and indicate ways in which it might be improved. State clearly what maximal size of image your system can process and how fast your system can evolve the Game of Life. (Make sure your teamâ€™s names, course, and email addresses appears on page 1 of the report.)
