    (2 pages max): Show the result of the given 16x16 image after 2 rounds. Describe briefly the other experiments you carried out, provide a selection of appropriate results and output images. This must be done for at least the example images provided and for at least one example image of your own choosing (showcasing the merit of your system). List the important factors responsible for virtues and limitations of your system.

    Our system can maximally process a \verb|1024x1024| image across 8 workers with an AGT of 1s, but can also process other smaller image sizes much faster (see Fig. \ref{fig:workers}). Figure 1 shows that the relationship between worker count and 
    
    
    Figure \ref{fig:workers} shows that increasing the number of workers also increases the effective processing speed. This relationship is \textit{somewhat} linear: doubling the workers from 1, 2, to 4 on the \verb|128x128| and \verb|256x256| images seem to also halve the average generation time. However, the relationship is weaker for \verb|64x64| and 8 workers across all image sizes, which implies that the system is bottlenecked by some other factor. We believe that it is bottlenecked by both processing speed and channel communication with the distributor, since it needs to collect the `ghost rows' before the generation can advance. 

    \textbf{Hard channels} are channels between cores while \textbf{soft channels} are between threads on the same core, so a way to reduce the effect of the bottleneck would be to prefer soft channel communcation over hard channel communication. Soft channels have lower latency ??
